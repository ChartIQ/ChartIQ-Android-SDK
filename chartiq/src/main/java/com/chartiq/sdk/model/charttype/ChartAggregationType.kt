     * (which bar to compare is determined by the user, see below). If the current bar’s close is higher than the one

     * it is being compared to, a red descending bar is drawn. If the current close is the same, or if the price does
     * not move enough in one direction or the other to signify a reversal, then no bar is drawn.</p>
