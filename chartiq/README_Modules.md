# Module ChartIQ documentation

# Package com.chartiq.sdk

The ChartIQ Android SDK provides a native interface for Android developers to instantiate and
interact with a ChartIQ chart. The interface creates a `WebView` and populates it with a predefined
HTML file that loads the ChartIQ JavaScript library, supporting CSS, and a JavaScript “bridge” file
which interfaces with the native application.

What occurs in the `WebView` is hidden, automatic, and not dependent on developer configuration. You
should be able to instantiate the object as you would any other native component and essentially
feel like you are working with a native component.
