# ChartIQ-Android-SDK

Native Android SDK for the [ChartIQ JavaScript library](https://documentation.chartiq.com).

The ChartIQ Android SDK supports a basic charting application. The SDK can be extended to support more elaborate implementations by adding code to invoke ChartIQ library functions directly or by creating a bridge file similar to *nativeSdkBridge.js* (in the *mobile/js* folder of your ChartIQ library).

Contact us at <support@chartiq.com> to request sample code and guidance on how to extend the SDK.

## Requirements

- Version 8.2.1 or later of the ChartIQ library

  For previous version support, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/ChartIQ/ChartIQ-Android-SDK/releases) section.

  Go to our <a href="https://cosaic.io/chartiq-sdk-library-download/" target="_blank">download site</a> to obtain a free 30-day trial version of the library, or send us an email at <info@cosaic.io>, and we'll send you an evaluation version.

- Android 8.1 Oreo (API level 27) or later

## App

The [demo](https://github.com/ChartIQ/ChartIQ-Android-SDK/tree/main/demo) folder of this repository contains an app that was built using the SDK. Customize the app to quickly create your own Android charting application.

The app is also available on Google Play.

**End of legacy app support**

The Android app has been totally reengineered for improved usability and functionality using Kotlin. As a result, there is no upgrade path from the [legacy app](https://github.com/ChartIQ/Charting-Library---Android-Sample-App-Legacy) (which is compatible with ChartIQ versions 7.0.5&ndash;7.5.0) to the new app/SDK. To take advantage of the major improvements offered by the new mobile app, upgrade to Version 8.2.0 or later of the library and reimplement any custom functionality from your legacy app in the new app.

## Getting started
